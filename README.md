# anonydog

A extremely simple Discord bot designed to facilitate anonymous messaging.

## Usage

You must create a `config.edn` file in the root directory (adjacent to README.md).
Its contents should appear as follows:

```clojure
{:token "DISCORD BOT TOKEN"
 :anon-nonce "INSERT ANY RANDOM STRING HERE"
 :playing "DM me and say !help"
 :anon-channel-id "CHANNEL ID WHERE DMs SHOULD BE FORWARDED"}
```

NOTE: The anon-nonce value must be kept secret.

Then, run the bot with `lein run`.
